# Bufo Provider

-> **Note:** Use at least Terraform [`v1.14.0-alpha20250806`](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/releases/tag/v1.14.0-alpha20250806) for running action examples.

The bufo provider has an action that can be used to print out a bufo image as ASCII art.
You can print a specific bufo by using one of the file names in this repo: https://github.com/austinvalle/terraform-provider-bufo/tree/main/internal/provider/bufos.

{{ tffile "examples/provider/provider.tf" }}

If no `name` is provided, a random bufo will be printed. You can set `color` to `true`, if your terminal supports it, for a colorized bufo.
