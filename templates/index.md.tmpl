# Bufo Provider

The bufo provider has an action that can be used to print out a bufo image as ASCII art.
You can print a specific bufo by using one of the file names (minus the extension) in this repo: https://github.com/austinvalle/terraform-provider-bufo/tree/main/internal/provider/bufos.

{{ tffile "examples/provider/provider.tf" }}

If no `name` is provided, a random bufo will be printed.

```terraform
action "bufo_print" "success" {
  config {} # random bufo
}
```

 You can set `color` to `true`, if your terminal supports it, for a colorized bufo.

```terraform
action "bufo_print" "success" {
  config { color = true } # random colorized bufo
}
```
